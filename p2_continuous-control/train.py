# In this notebook, you will learn how to use the Unity ML-Agents environment for the second project of the [Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893) program.
# 
# ### 1. Start the Environment
# 
# We begin by importing the necessary packages.  If the code cell below returns an error, please revisit the project instructions to double-check that you have installed [Unity ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation.md) and [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/).

# In[1]:


from unityagents import UnityEnvironment
import numpy as np


# Next, we will start the environment!  **_Before running the code cell below_**, change the `file_name` parameter to match the location of the Unity environment that you downloaded.
# 
# - **Mac**: `"path/to/Reacher.app"`
# - **Windows** (x86): `"path/to/Reacher_Windows_x86/Reacher.exe"`
# - **Windows** (x86_64): `"path/to/Reacher_Windows_x86_64/Reacher.exe"`
# - **Linux** (x86): `"path/to/Reacher_Linux/Reacher.x86"`
# - **Linux** (x86_64): `"path/to/Reacher_Linux/Reacher.x86_64"`
# - **Linux** (x86, headless): `"path/to/Reacher_Linux_NoVis/Reacher.x86"`
# - **Linux** (x86_64, headless): `"path/to/Reacher_Linux_NoVis/Reacher.x86_64"`
# 
# For instance, if you are using a Mac, then you downloaded `Reacher.app`.  If this file is in the same folder as the notebook, then the line below should appear as follows:
# ```
# env = UnityEnvironment(file_name="Reacher.app")
# ```

# In[2]:

import torch
env = UnityEnvironment(file_name='env/Reacher_Linux_NoVis/Reacher.x86_64')


# Environments contain **_brains_** which are responsible for deciding the actions of their associated agents. Here we check for the first brain available, and set it as the default brain we will be controlling from Python.

# In[3]:


# get the default brain
brain_name = env.brain_names[0]
brain = env.brains[brain_name]


# ### 2. Examine the State and Action Spaces
# 
# In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of `+0.1` is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.
# 
# The observation space consists of `33` variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm.  Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints.  Every entry in the action vector must be a number between `-1` and `1`.
# 
# Run the code cell below to print some information about the environment.

# In[4]:


# reset the environment
env_info = env.reset(train_mode=True)[brain_name]

# number of agents
num_agents = len(env_info.agents)
print('Number of agents:', num_agents)

# size of each action
action_size = brain.vector_action_space_size
print('Size of each action:', action_size)

# examine the state space 
states = env_info.vector_observations
state_size = states.shape[1]
print('There are {} agents. Each observes a state with length: {}'.format(states.shape[0], state_size))
print('The state for the first agent looks like:', states[0])


# ### 3. Take Random Actions in the Environment
# 
# In the next code cell, you will learn how to use the Python API to control the agent and receive feedback from the environment.
# 
# Once this cell is executed, you will watch the agent's performance, if it selects an action at random with each time step.  A window should pop up that allows you to observe the agent, as it moves through the environment.  
# 
# Of course, as part of the project, you'll have to change the code so that the agent is able to use its experience to gradually choose better actions when interacting with the environment!
